Tasks worked upon but not completed since last meeting
  [Sally] - JUnit Test
	* Each team must write JUnit tests and the project code which passes these tests for the following features. 
    Each bulleted item must be defined in its own method. JUnit test method names should clearly identify the item which they are testing.
    - Submission includes a file, named tests.txt, which lists your 3-team variant test methods and the specific requirement for which it was written [2 points]
    - Creates a List containing randomly generated assignments for each of the 6 Red Agents, 5 Blue Agents, 5 Green Agents, 7 Innocent Bystanders, and 2 Assassins [3 points]
    - Method defined which correctly returns whether or not the Board is in one of the winning states [5 points]
    - Method defined which correctly returns which team wins once the 2nd Assassin is revealed [8 points]
    - Method which returns which is used at the end of a turn to determine the team whose move is next (this must include the possibility that the next team in the 3-team rotation had previously Revealed an Assassin) [7 points]
  [Winnie] - GUI
    - Defines a GUI application that includes the File menu with menu items to start a new 2-team game, start a new 3-team game, and to quit the application [3 points]
    - The application quits using the menu item from the File menu AND still works correctly when playing a 2-team game of Codewords [12 points]
    - Choosing the new 3-team game menu item resets the Locations to not be revealed, assigns codewords using a new random choice of 25 words, and a new random assignment of where the Agents, Assassin, and 
       Innocent Bystanders are placed. (You program should read this file for the full list of possible codewords). [6 points]

    - Update functionality of turns
