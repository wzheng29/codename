      2.Creates List containing 25 distinct codenames selected at random (hint: Java has some methods that could be a starting point for your implementation)
      3.Creates List containing randomly generated assignments for each of the 9 Red Agents, 8 Blue Agents, 7 Innocent Bystanders, and 1 Assassin (hint: Java has some methods that could be a starting point for how to randomly order locations)
      4.When game started, it is Red team's move and each of Board's 25 Location instances is assigned a codename, Person, and is Not Revealed
      5.Method defined which correctly returns if a clue is legal or illegal (clues cannot equal a current codename unless that codename is in a locations that was already Revealed) 
      6.Method defined which decrements the count, updates a Location when the Location's codename was selected, and returns if the Location contained the current team's Agent
      7.Method defined which correctly returns whether or not the Board is in one of the winning states
