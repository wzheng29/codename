Document of Merge Changes:

We had 2 Versions of whoWonAssassinRevealed() and I had to decide between the 2 of them.

Requirement: Method defined which correctly returns which team did not lose (i.e., win) when the Assassin was revealed [10 points]

Although Version 1 has extra functionality, I chose Version 2 because it does only what the phase requires.
Perhaps they wanted this method to be called once an assassin was "Revealed" and want us to later implement a method that returns the winner at all times.

Version 1:
	public String whoWonAssassinRevealed() {
		if (this.isInWinningState()) {
		  int redscore = _tilesRevealed.get("Red");
	      int bluescore = _tilesRevealed.get("Blue");
	      if (redscore == 9) {
	        return new String("Red");
	      }
	      else if (bluescore == 8) {
	        return new String("Blue");
	      }
	      else if (this.get_isRedTurn()) {
	        return new String("Blue");
	      }
	      return new String("Red");
		}
    return null;
	}
	
Version 2:
	public String whoWonAssassinRevealed() {
		if(_tilesRevealed.get("Assassin")==1) {
			if(_isRedTurn==true) {
				return "Blue";
			}
			else return "Red";
		}
		return null;
	}
