Tasks completed since last meeting
	* Finished Phase 1 
  * Started the GUI:
    - Defines a GUI application that includes the File menu with menu items to start a new game and quit the application
    - The application displays 25 Locations so they appear as 5 rows each of which has 5 columns
    - Choosing the menu item to exit the program ends the application

Tasks worked upon but not completed since last meeting
  * Choosing the new game menu item resets the system to a brand new game starting with the red team's turn
    - Loading a new game without opening a new window.
    - Each new game resets the Locations to not be revealed, assigns codewords using a new random choice of 25 words, 
      and a new random assignment of where the Agents, Assassin, and Innocent Bystanders are placed

Goals for the next meeting
